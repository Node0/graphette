# Project Graphette

**Python-based complement to Gluon, emphasizing dynamic runtime plugins and rapid prototyping.**

Graphette is a Python implementation of the same architectural blueprint as Gluon, favoring runtime flexibility over compile-time enforcement. It loads backend plugins dynamically, supporting JSON-based IRS (Intermediate Representational Schema) and runtime-generated schemas and resolvers. It is a simpler implementation of the ideas that led to Gluon and lacks the high-performance hallmarks of Gluon.
